Do you think you could also do the case with the simplified temperature
curve? I am thinking of the following: fit the existing temperature
curve with a cosine function (I think you have already done that). Then
calculate t^* for both species from the formula. Then increase the
temperature by 1/2 degree, 1, 1/5, 2... and calculate t^* for both.
Finally, calculate the sensitivity according to the formula. Plot the
emergence days versus the linear approximation.  Actually, I think you
have done most of that already. Let me know if you have any questions.
