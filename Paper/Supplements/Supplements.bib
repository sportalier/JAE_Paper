abstract = {A common and simple approach to evaluate models is to regress predicted vs. observed values (or vice versa) and compare slope and intercept parameters against the 1:1 line. However, based on a review of the literature it seems to be no consensus on which variable (predicted or observed) should be placed in each axis. Although some researchers think that it is identical, probably because r2 is the same for both regressions, the intercept and the slope of each regression differ and, in turn, may change the result of the model evaluation. We present mathematical evidence showing that the regression of predicted (in the y-axis) vs. observed data (in the x-axis) (PO) to evaluate models is incorrect and should lead to an erroneous estimate of the slope and intercept. In other words, a spurious effect is added to the regression parameters when regressing PO values and comparing them against the 1:1 line. Observed (in the y-axis) vs. predicted (in the x-axis) (OP) regressions should be used instead. We also show in an example from the literature that both approaches produce significantly different results that may change the conclusions of the model evaluation.},

@article{Wu2013,
abstract = {Sensitivity analysis (SA) can aid in identifying influential model parameters and optimizing model structure, yet infectious disease modelling has yet to adopt advanced SA techniques that are capable of providing considerable insights over traditional methods. We investigate five global SA methods-scatter plots, the Morris and Sobol' methods, Latin hypercube sampling-partial rank correlation coefficient and the sensitivity heat map method-and detail their relative merits and pitfalls when applied to a microparasite (cholera) and macroparasite (schistosomaisis) transmission model. The methods investigated yielded similar results with respect to identifying influential parameters, but offered specific insights that vary by method. The classical methods differed in their ability to provide information on the quantitative relationship between parameters and model output, particularly over time. The heat map approach provides information about the group sensitivity of all model state variables, and the parameter sensitivity spectrum obtained using this method reveals the sensitivity of all state variables to each parameter over the course of the simulation period, especially valuable for expressing the dynamic sensitivity of a microparasite epidemic model to its parameters. A summary comparison is presented to aid infectious disease modellers in selecting appropriate methods, with the goal of improving model performance and design.},
